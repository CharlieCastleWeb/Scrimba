                            Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning

                            After several months of learning in the Frontend
                            Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over
                            to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my
                            Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
                    <p class="post-content">
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used
                        to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
                        simple projects using what I learned or work new
                        techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-content">
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to
                        share what I was learning and most things about my
                        journey with the world.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How I got started</h4>
                    <p class="post-content">
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal
                        site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not
                        only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-content">
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized
                        that posting my learning summaries was also helping
                        others learn and stay motivated.
